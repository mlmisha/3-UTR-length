Hello! This is where scripts I used to analyse the data are stored. 

### Contents

- `3UTR.Rmd` is the main one. It's an R-Markdown file with comments, containg almost all the analysis conducted 
- `gene_extractor.py` is the script to extract list of genes with specific GO categories we were interested in from the results of enrichment analysis.
- `small_utrs.py` is a script to find organsims with relatively small median values of 3'UTR length. It works with files in `../data/Org_tables/`
- `session_info.txt` contains information about the R session
