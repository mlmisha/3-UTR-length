These are the final tables with 3'UTR lengths for each organism separately, as well as merged together. 

All tables have the same structure:

Ensembl transcript ID, Stop codon, 3'UTR length in nt

The header is abscent in all the tables. 

- Archives `{NUMBER}.zip` contain separate tables. Their contents to find the requiered organism are described in `Folders_content.md`
- Archives `TOTAL_{NUMBER}.zip` parts of big table with all the data merged. As it wsa to big even after compression we had to split into pieces.
