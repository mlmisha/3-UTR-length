Hello! This is where some of the results of analysis are presented.  

### Contents

- `GENES_50_HUM.tsv` is the list of genes from the result of enrichment analysis of human genes with transcripts having small (<=50 nt) 3'UTRs, filtered by the GO categories of interest
- `hum_10.tsv` is a table of 3'UTR lengths belonging to the genes from the results of enrichment analysis of the first group (up to 10 nt)
- `hum_10_go.tsv` is the result of enrichment analysis of human genes which transcripts have 3'UTR <= 10 nt
- `hum_10.tsv` is a table of 3'UTR lengths belonging to the genes from the results of enrichment analysis of the second group (11-50 nt)
- `hum_11_50_go.tsv` is the result of enrichment analysis of human genes which transcripts have 3'UTR from 11 up to 50 nt among all GO terms
- `hum_11_50_go_zer_ribo.txt` is `hum_11_50_go.tsv` filtered by the GO categories of interest (ribosomes and translation) 
- `small_10.tsv` is the list of human genes having transcipts only with 3'UTRs up to 10 nt
- `small_50.tsv` is the list of human genes having transcripts with only short (11-50 nt) 3'UTRs associated with ribosomes and translation
