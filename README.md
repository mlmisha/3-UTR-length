Hello! This is the repository corresponding to the research on the distribution of lengths of 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of the eukaryotic transcripts. (2024)

### About

The study is the part of the bigger experimental research on 3' untraslated regions in eukaryotes. One of the parts of the research is to analyse how length of 3'UTR correleates with translation efficiency  and mRNA stability.
It raised the question of how naturally lengths of 3'UTR differ among the eukaryotes. To answer this question we analysed the database of eukaryotic untraslated regions UTRdb 2.0 (http://utrdb.cloud.ba.infn.it/utrdb/index_107.html) where information about over 570 organisms is presented.

### Contents

- Data was obtained with scripts presented in the `scripts_data` folder. 
- Raw obtained data can be seen in the folder `data`. All files are TSV tables each corresponding to specific organism.
- Main part of the analysis was made via R, relevant scripts are in the `scripts_analysis` folder.
