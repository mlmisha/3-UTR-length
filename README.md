Hello! This is the repository corresponding to the research on the distribution of lengths of 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of human protein-coding transcripts. (2024)

---
### About

The study is the part of the bigger experimental research on 3' untraslated regions in eukaryotes. One of the parts of the research is to analyse how length of 3'UTR correleates with translation efficiency and mRNA stability.
It raised the question of how naturally lengths of 3'UTR differ in the human transcriptome. To answer this question we analysed the GENCODE human protein-coding transcripts annotation (GENCODE v47, Rel. Oct 2024, GRCh38.p14).

### Contents

- Data was obtained with scripts presented in the `scripts_data` folder. 
- Raw obtained data and other data used for analysis can be seen in the folder `data`
- Main part of the analysis was made via R, relevant scripts are in the `scripts_analysis` folder.
